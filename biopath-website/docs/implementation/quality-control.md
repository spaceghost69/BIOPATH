# Quality Control

## Overview

Quality control is paramount when working with peptides. This guide outlines essential practices for ensuring product quality, safety, and efficacy.

## Supplier Verification

### Certificate of Analysis (COA)
- Request COA for every batch
- Verify purity percentages
- Check for contaminants
- Confirm molecular weight
- Review testing methods

### Third-Party Testing
- Independent laboratory verification
- HPLC analysis results
- Mass spectrometry confirmation
- Endotoxin testing
- Sterility testing

### Supplier Credentials
- GMP facility certification
- Regulatory compliance history
- Industry reputation
- Customer references
- Quality management systems

## Storage Requirements

### Temperature Control
- Lyophilized: 2-8°C (refrigerated)
- Reconstituted: 2-8°C (refrigerated)
- Avoid freezing unless specified
- Monitor temperature consistently
- Use temperature logging devices

### Environmental Factors
- Protect from light exposure
- Maintain low humidity
- Avoid temperature fluctuations
- Use appropriate containers
- Label with storage dates

### Inventory Management
