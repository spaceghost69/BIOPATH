## Administration Methods

| Method | Absorption | Onset | Duration | Best For |
|--------|------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Subcutaneous** | 85-95% | 15-30 min | 4-8 hours | Most peptides, systemic effects |
| **Intramuscular** | 90-100% | 10-20 min | 6-12 hours | MOTS-c, TB-500 |
| **Oral** | 10-30% | 30-60 min | 2-6 hours | BPC-157, Noopept |
| **Topical** | 20-40% | 30-90 min | 4-12 hours | GHK-Cu, localized effects |
| **Nasal** | 60-80% | 5-15 min | 2-4 hours | Selank, Semax |

## Stacking Synergies

### Power Combinations
- **CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin**: Synergistic GH release
- **BPC-157 + TB-500**: Comprehensive healing
- **MOTS-c + CJC-1295**: Metabolic + growth optimization
- **GHK-Cu + BPC-157**: Enhanced healing and aesthetics
- **Thymosin Alpha-1 + BPC-157**: Immune + gut health

### Avoid Combining
- Multiple GH peptides at high doses
- Cognitive peptides with sedatives
- High-dose healing peptides (diminishing returns)

## Timing Guidelines

### Pre-Workout (30-60 min before)
- MOTS-c: Enhanced performance and fat burning
- BPC-157: Joint protection and recovery prep

### Post-Workout (within 2 hours)
- BPC-157: Accelerated recovery
- TB-500: Tissue repair initiation
- CJC-1295: Growth factor release

### Before Bed (1-3 hours)
- CJC-1295: Maximize sleep GH release
- Ipamorelin: Sleep quality improvement
- GHK-Cu: Overnight skin repair

### Morning (empty stomach)
- Thymosin Alpha-1: Immune system activation
- Cognitive peptides: Mental clarity for the day
- MOTS-c: Metabolic priming

## Storage Quick Reference

| Storage Type | Temperature | Duration | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Lyophilized (powder)** | -20°C | 2+ years | Long-term storage |
| **Lyophilized (powder)** | 2-8°C | 6-12 months | Short-term storage |
| **Reconstituted** | 2-8°C | 30 days | Use bacteriostatic water |
| **Reconstituted** | Room temp | 24-48 hours | Emergency only |

## Red Flags - When to Stop

### Immediate Discontinuation
- Severe allergic reactions
- Persistent injection site reactions
- Unusual mood changes or depression
- Significant blood pressure changes

### Consult Healthcare Provider
- Persistent headaches
- Changes in sleep patterns
- Digestive issues lasting >1 week
- Any concerning symptoms

## Legal Status Quick Check

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Research Peptides** | Gray area | "Research purposes only" |
| **Cosmetic Peptides** | Generally legal | Topical applications |
| **Prescription Required** | Varies by location | Some require medical oversight |
| **Banned Substances** | Check WADA list | Athletes must verify |

## Cost Optimization

### Budget-Friendly Stacks
- **Starter**: BPC-157 + basic multivitamin
- **Intermediate**: BPC-157 + CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin
- **Advanced**: Full longevity stack with cycling

### Premium Protocols
- Comprehensive testing and monitoring
- Multiple peptide combinations
- Professional oversight and optimization

## Emergency Protocols

### Injection Site Reaction
1. Apply ice for 10-15 minutes
2. Monitor for spreading or worsening
3. Discontinue if severe
4. Seek medical attention if systemic symptoms

### Overdose Concerns
- Most peptides have wide safety margins
- Symptoms typically mild (nausea, headache)
- Hydrate and rest
- Contact healthcare provider if severe
