# BPC-157: The Universal Healer

:::tip Why BPC-157 is Special
BPC-157 is often called the "universal healer" because of its remarkable ability to accelerate healing across multiple tissue types - from tendons and muscles to the gut lining and even neural tissue.
:::

## Overview

**BPC-157** (Body Protection Compound-157) is a synthetic peptide derived from a protein found in human gastric juice. It has gained significant attention in the optimization community for its powerful healing and protective properties across multiple organ systems.

## Mechanisms of Action

<div className="mechanism-diagram">

### Primary Pathways

**Angiogenesis Enhancement** ‚Üí Promotes new blood vessel formation  
**Growth Factor Modulation** ‚Üí Upregulates VEGF, EGF, and FGF  
**Nitric Oxide Regulation** ‚Üí Balances NO production for optimal healing  
**GABAergic System** ‚Üí Modulates neurotransmitter activity

</div>

### Detailed Mechanisms

#### 1. Angiogenesis Promotion
BPC-157 stimulates the formation of new blood vessels, crucial for:
- Delivering nutrients to healing tissues
- Removing metabolic waste products
- Supporting tissue regeneration

**Research**: Studies show BPC-157 increases VEGF expression by up to 3-fold in healing tissues.

#### 2. Growth Factor Modulation
The peptide influences multiple growth factors:
- **VEGF** (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)
- **EGF** (Epidermal Growth Factor)  
- **FGF** (Fibroblast Growth Factor)
- **PDGF** (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)

#### 3. Collagen Synthesis
BPC-157 enhances collagen production and organization, leading to:
- Stronger tissue repair
- Improved scar formation
- Better long-term tissue integrity

#### 4. Anti-Inflammatory Effects
Reduces inflammatory markers while promoting healing:
- Decreases TNF-Œ± and IL-6
- Modulates prostaglandin production
- Balances inflammatory response
