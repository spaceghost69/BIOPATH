# TB-500: The Regeneration Catalyst

:::tip Why TB-500 is Unique
TB-500 is the only peptide that directly regulates actin, a protein essential for cell structure and movement. This makes it incredibly effective for tissue regeneration, flexibility improvement, and comprehensive healing.
:::

## Overview

**TB-500** (Thymosin Beta-4) is a naturally occurring peptide present in virtually all human and animal cells. It plays a crucial role in tissue repair, wound healing, and cellular regeneration. TB-500 is the synthetic version of the active region of Thymosin Beta-4, optimized for therapeutic use.

<div className="peptide-card">

### Quick Facts
- **Full Name**: Thymosin Beta-4 (TB-500 is the active fragment)
- **Sequence**: 43 amino acids
- **Molecular Weight**: 4963 Da
- **Half-life**: ~7-10 days
- **Primary Function**: Actin regulation and tissue regeneration

</div>

## Mechanisms of Action

<div className="mechanism-diagram">

### Primary Pathways

**Actin Regulation** → Controls cell structure and movement  
**Angiogenesis** → Promotes new blood vessel formation  
**Cell Migration** → Facilitates healing cell movement  
**Anti-Inflammatory** → Reduces tissue inflammation

</div>

### Detailed Mechanisms

#### 1. Actin Binding and Regulation

TB-500's unique mechanism centers on actin regulation:

- **Binds to G-actin**: Prevents polymerization into F-actin
- **Promotes cell migration**: Allows cells to move to injury sites
- **Enhances flexibility**: Improves tissue elasticity and range of motion
- **Facilitates repair**: Enables structural reorganization during healing

**Research**: TB-500 is the only known peptide that directly binds to actin, making it uniquely effective for structural tissue repair.

#### 2. Angiogenesis and Vascularization

TB-500 promotes new blood vessel formation through:

- **VEGF upregulation**: Increases vascular endothelial growth factor
- **Endothelial cell migration**: Helps blood vessels grow into damaged areas
- **Improved circulation**: Enhances nutrient and oxygen delivery
- **Waste removal**: Better clearance of metabolic byproducts

#### 3. Stem Cell Activation

TB-500 activates and mobilizes various stem cell populations:

- **Satellite cell activation**: Promotes muscle stem cell activity
- **Mesenchymal stem cells**: Enhances differentiation into various tissue types
- **Cardiac stem cells**: Supports heart tissue regeneration
- **Neural stem cells**: May support nervous system repair

#### 4. Anti-Inflammatory Effects

Reduces inflammation while promoting healing:

- **Cytokine modulation**: Balances pro- and anti-inflammatory signals
- **Immune cell regulation**: Optimizes immune response for healing
- **Tissue protection**: Prevents excessive inflammatory damage
- **Resolution promotion**: Helps transition from inflammation to repair
